		 				<div class="ms-3 mt-1">
		 				<p>Had their forefathers not adopted other names, Jose and Paciano could have been known as "<b><i>Lamco</i></b>" (and not Rizal) brothers.

						Their paternal great-great grandfather, Chinese merchant <b>Domingo Lamco</b>, adopted the name "<b><i>Mercado</i></b>," which means "<b><i>market</i></b>." But Jose's father, Francisco, who eventually became primarily a farmer, adopted the surname "<b><i>Rizal</i></b>" (originally "<i>Ricial</i>", which means "<i>the green of young growth</i>" or "<i>green fields</i>"). The name was suggested by a provincial governor who was a friend of the family. The new name, however, caused confusion in the commercial affairs of the family. Don Francisco thus settled on the name "<i><b>Rizal Mercado</b></i>" as a compromise, and often just used his more known surname "<b>Mercado</b>."</br></br>

						When Paciano was a student at the College of San Jose, he used "<b>Mercado</b>" as his last name. But because he had gained notoriety with his links to Father Burgos of the "<b><i>Gomburza</i></b>," he suggested that Jose use the surname "<b>Rizal</b>" for Jose's own safety.</br></br>

						Commenting on using the name "<b>Rizal</b>" at Ateneo, Jose once wrote: "<i>My family never paid much attention [to our second surname Rizal], but now I had to use it. thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!</i>" (as cited in Arriza, 2012, para. 8)</br></br>

						But this very name suggested by Paciano to be used by his brother had become so well known by <b>1891</b>, the year Jose finished his <b>El Filibusterismo</b>. As Jose wrote to a friend, "<i>All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution! Good! I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name...</i>" (as cited in Arriza, 2012, para. 8).</p>

		 					<p class="ms-5 mt-2">Jose's father, <b>Francisco Engracio Rizal Mercado</b>, was a productive farmer from <b>Biñan, Laguna</b>. He was an independent-minded, taciturn, but dynamic gentleman from whom Jose inherited his "free soul." Don Francisco became <i><b>tiniente gobernadorcillo</b></i> (lieutenant governor) in Calamba and was thus nicknamed <b>Tiniente Kiko</b>. (Some students' comical conjecture that the fictional character Kikong Matsing of Batibot was named after Don Francisco is, of course, unfounded.)</p>
		 					</br>
		 				</div>
		 					<p class="ms-4 mt-4">Francisco's great grandfather was <b>Domingo Lam-co</b>, a learned pro-poor or maka-masa Chinese immigrant businessman who married a sophisticated Chinese mestiza of Manila named <b>Ines de la Rosa</b>. One of their two children, <b>Francisco</b> (<b>also</b>), resided in Biñan and married <b>Bernarda Monicha</b>. Francisco and Bernarda's son. <b>Juan Mercado</b>, became the <b><i>gobernadorcillo</i></b> (town mayor) of Biñan, Laguna. He married <b>Cirila Alejandra</b>, and they had 12 children, the youngest being Jose Rizal's father, <b>Francisco</b>.</p>

							<p class="ms-4 mt-4">Don Francisco was born on <b>May 11, 1818</b> in <b>Biñan, Laguna</b>. When he was eight years old, he lost his father. He was nonetheless educated as he took <b>Latin and Philosophy</b> at the <b>College of San Jose</b> in Manila, where he met and fell in love with <b>Teodora Alonso</b>, a student in the <b>College of Santa Rosa</b>. Married on <b>June 28, 1848</b>, they settled down in Calamba where they were granted lease of a rice farm in the Dominican-owned haciendas.</p>

		 					<p class="ms-5 mt-2">Jose's mother, <b>Teodora Alonzo</b> (also spelled "Alonso"), was an educated and highly cultured woman from <b>Sta. Cruz, Manila</b>. Common biographies state that Doña <b>Teodora Alonso Quintos Realonda</b>, also known as <b>"Lolay."</b> was born on <b>November 8, 1826</b> in <b>Santa Cruz, Manila</b> and baptized at the Santa Cruz Church. Strangely however, the volume in the church books that supposedly contained Teodora's baptismal records was the only one missing from the otherwise complete records down to the eighteenth century (Ocampo, 2012, p. 39). Asuncion Rizal-Lopez Bantug, the granddaughter of Jose's sister Narcisa, contrarily claims that Lola Lolay and all her siblings were born in Calamba, but (just) lived in Manila (Bantug & Ventura, 1997, p. 18).</p>
		 					</br>
		 				</div>
		 				<div class="ms-4 mt-4">
			 				<p>Doña Lolay was educated at the <b>College of Santa Rosa</b>, an esteemed school for girls in Manila. She was usually described as a diligent business-minded woman, very graceful but courageous, well-mannered, religious, and well-read. Very dignified, she disliked gossip and vulgar conversation. Possessing refined culture and literary talents, she <b>influenced her children to love the arts, literature, and music</b>. Herself an educated woman, Lolay sent her children to colleges in Manila. To help in the economy of the family, she ran <b>sugar</b> and <b>flour mills</b> and a <b>small store</b> in their house, selling <b>home-made ham</b>, <b>sausages</b>, <b>jams</b>, <b>jellies</b>, and many others. (Looking back, her business, in a way, predated the meat-processing commerce of the Pampangueños today and the ube jam production of some nuns in Baguio.)</p>

							<p>It is believed that Doña Teodora's family descended from <b><i>Lakandula</i></b>, the <b>last native king of Tondo</b>. (For young Filipino generations. Lakandula has to be distinguished from the unofficial Hari ng Tondo, Asiong Salonga, the Manila kingpin who was immortalized in the movie incidentally by Laguna's own governor E. R. Ejercito.)</p>

							<P>Lolay's great-grandfather was <b>Eugenio Ursua</b> (of Japanese descent) who married a Filipina named <b>Benigna</b>. <b>Regina</b>, their daughter, married a Filipino- Chinese lawyer of Pangasinan, <b>Manuel de Quintos</b>. <b>Lorenzo Alberto Alonso</b>, a well- off Spanish-Filipino mestizo of Biñan, took as his "significant other" <b>Brigida Quintos</b>, daughter of Manuel and Regina Quintos. The Lorenzo-Brigida union produced five children, the second of them was Jose Rizal's mother, <b>Teodora Alonso Quintos</b>.</P>

							<p>Through the <b>Claveria decree</b> of <b>1849</b> which changed the Filipino native surnames, the Alonsos adopted the surname <b>Realonda</b>. Rizal's mother thus became <b>Teodora Alonso Quintos Realonda</b>.</p>

		 					</br></br>After Jose's execution in December 1896, Paciano joined the <b>Katipuneros</b> in Cavite under <b>General Emilio Aguinaldo</b>.
